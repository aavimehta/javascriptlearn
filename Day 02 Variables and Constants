#VARIABLES in Java Script

-> Like any other language variables in javascript are used to store information.
-> each variable has a name associated with it so that it information stored in it can be referred to in later parts of the program and therefore 
    we often call variables “named storage”.
-> For example : 
Say you wrote a program for a convenience store now we can have named storages (variables) for customer id, customer name and so on.

-> to create a variable in java script a reserved keyword “let” is used as follows:

let customerId;
 customerId = 209;

-> Reserved keywords are the words that have already been used by the language so you as a user can not used those reserved  
    keywords to create variables(named storages).

-> there are different ways to declare variables one can use shorthand for the above declaration if they like as follows :
 let customerId = 209;

-> you can also declare multiple variables in a single line separated by commas as is a common practice in many other languages 
let customerId = 209, customerName = “Avinash”;


-> Now here is the simple rule you can only declare a variable with a name only once in your program in simple terms the following lines of is incorrect :

let customerName = “Avinash”;
let customerName = “Shobhit”;

-> But you can assign a variable value as many times as you want, the variable will be updated with the new value and the 
    older value will be deleted from the storage. For example:

let customerName = “Avinash”;
customerName = “Shobhit”;


Now if you run the following statement :

alert(customerName);

Avinash will be deleted from the storage and Shobhit will get stored there and you will see “Shobhit” printed there.

-> The one thing that I have followed while writing the above codes if you have noticed is that I have followed CAMEL CASING
    while declaring the variables which is a general that we follow while declaring variables in Java Script, that first letter of each word(except the initial one)  
    is capital and all the others are smaller.

-> The other rule is that a variable name can only have letter or digits and also can have the symbols $ and _.

-> The first character of a variable name can not be a digit.

-> The following declarations are considered in correct in JavaScript: 

let 2-customer;

-> Neither can a variable name start with a digit nor can it have symbols other than $ and _ .

-> JavaScript is a Case Sensitive language so,

let customer_name = “Avinash”;
let CUSTOMER_name  = “Shobhit”;

Is a valid declaration, although the one used above is not a good practice, I have just used it just for the purpose of illustration.


#CONSTANTS IN Java Script

-> There could be a case that we do not want a name storage to change its value through out the program execution once it is assigned a value,   
  no matter whether the value is assigned implicitly or explicitly, such variables are declared using const keyword in java script instead of let keyword as used above.
  For example we don’t want the value of customer_id to be changed once it has been assigned so use the following declaration.

const CUSTOMER_ID = 01;

Now, 

const customer_id;

If we include both the lines in our program it won’t throw an error since javascript is a case sensitive language and both of them represent different named storages, 
  but the question is which one is better to use? 

-> The answer to above question will be that we use all letter capitalized when we have to explicitly assign the value to a constant, 
whereas the second one is used when the value to the constant will be assigned during execution and we want it to remain same throughout the execution of the program.

-> It always a best practice to name variables and constant with meaningful names so that it makes sense to the another person who is reading your code even after years, 
hence it should be clear and should tell what it stores, it is not a good practice to name your variables as a, b, c as they make no sense in regards of the program.
